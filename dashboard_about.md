## Information on U.S. CARES Act Spending Dashboard

### Intro
U.S. citizens were not provided with much transparency on CARES Act spending. Curious taxpayers have the right to know who their money is being distributed to. Because of this, Good Jobs First and Grassroot Connection released a project providing CARES Act loan & grant recipient data gathered through SEC filings. They also include a good bit of information on company accountability. I decided to use this data to help people get a better idea of what industries were either impacted most by COVID loans, or favored in priority by the current administration.

Since I first released this project, much more information has been released - with some being directly from the U.S. government. Unfortunately, the government-provided data only provides ranges of monetary amounts and a [below acceptable](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/judge-orders-trump-administration-reveal-ppp-loan-data-it-sought-n1246792) amount of information on the businesses was released. The [data source](https://covidstimuluswatch.org/sources) used gives more exact figures based on filings for these companies.
