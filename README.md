# U.S. CARES Act Data 


## [Link to Dashboard](https://atamalu.shinyapps.io/covid_loans/)

## Introduction

Disclaimer: the dashboard was made with the full data set. The markdowns were made from a ~50% size sample of the data.
U.S. citizens were not provided with much transparency on CARES Act spending. Curious taxpayers have the right to know who their money is being distributed to. Because of this, <i>Good Jobs First</i> and <i>Grassroot Connection</i> released a project providing CARES Act loan & grant recipient data gathered through SEC filings. They also include a good bit of information on company accountability. For more details on the data, please see [their website](https://covidstimuluswatch.org/sources).

I decided to use this data to get a better idea of what industries and companies were impacted the most by the COVID-19 pandemic; along with who was provided grants over loans, monetary amounts, and whatever else came to mind. I created a dashboard for people to explore the data, and markdowns for answering further questions. Within each "chapter" of this repository, I have added:

* basic markdowns for learning and data exploration
* full, "extended" markdowns for recreating results and figures
* recap of results and figures alone for factual and sharing purposes
