# COVID-19 Loan Data (United States)

## Introduction

Up until recent negotiations, the U.S. Department of Treasury had no legitimate intentions of releasing grant and loan data. Curious taxpayers had to simply wonder who their money was being distributed to, and potentially even if some of it was going to politicians and allies' shell companies. As a response, <i>Good Jobs First</i> and <i>Grassroot Connection</i> released a project providing the next best thing: data gathered through SEC filings. They also include a good bit of information on company accountability. For more details on the data, please see [their website](https://covidstimuluswatch.org/sources).

I decided to use this data to get a better idea of what industries and companies were impacted the most by the COVID-19 pandemic; along with who was provided grants over loans, monetary amounts, and whatever else came to mind. Within each "chapter" of this repository, I have added:

* simple markdowns for learning and basic data exploration
* full, "extended" markdowns for recreating results and figures
* the results and figures alone for factual and sharing purposes

This project will be updated throughout June and July, and will be updated bi-weekly.
